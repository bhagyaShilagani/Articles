# 3. Extracting One (or more) Pages from a PDF
Have you ever wondered how you could extract pages from a PDF? For example, imagine one of the pages is an image and you want just that, how would you do it?

Last night I was about to do a screen capture of the page when I tried a simple hack. I bet lot of you know this but thought of sharing it anyways. I selected Print, and then “Print to PDF”, and then clicked “Current Page". And that’s it. Pretty obvious, but I never thought of doing “Save as PDF” with an actual PDF. As you can see, you can also select Pages to get a range of pages instead of just one.

# 5. Markov Chains - text generator algorithm
Markov Chains --> State Machines with State transitions which are probabilities. 
For Example Word: Chicken; possible next Words : 10% - is ; 30% - was; 50% - legs; 10% - runs;
Simply choose the next word randomly. You get these probabilities from some input text.
Google's Search Engine uses [Page Rank Algo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) which is based on Markov Chains,

# 6. Data Structures and Algo
1. DS: Stacks(LILO), Queue(FIFO), Array, Linked Lists (SinglyLL, DoublyLL, CircularLL), 
2. Trees (BT) - Deleting a node having L R child: get the smallest child on the right subtree and replace with the node being deleted. Then delete the smallest node of the right subtree
3. Searching: Linear, Binary
4. Sorting: Insertion, Selection, Quick, Merge, Bucket, Quick
5. Performance: Big O notation
6. Tree Traversal (Recursive Search)
...PostOrdered(LeftRightParent DEBFGCA), InOrdered(LeftParentRight DBEAFCG), PreOrdered(ParentLeftRight ABDECFG): Depth First Traversal
...LevelOrdered: Breadth First Traversal(Tricky ABCDEFG)
7. Diff betweeb BST[O(n) when BT is a single LL is the worst case when data is already sorted] and Balanced BST[O(log n) worst case] - minimum tree height for better searching. On an average they perform the same. 
8. Java has built in [TreeSet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html) class
