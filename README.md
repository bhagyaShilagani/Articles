# 3. Extracting One (or more) Pages from a PDF
Have you ever wondered how you could extract pages from a PDF? For example, imagine one of the pages is an image and you want just that, how would you do it?

Last night I was about to do a screen capture of the page when I tried a simple hack. I bet lot of you know this but thought of sharing it anyways. I selected Print, and then “Print to PDF”, and then clicked “Current Page". And that’s it. Pretty obvious, but I never thought of doing “Save as PDF” with an actual PDF. As you can see, you can also select Pages to get a range of pages instead of just one.

# 5. Markov Chains - text generator algorithm
Markov Chains --> State Machines with State transitions which are probabilities. 
For Example Word: Chicken; possible next Words : 10% - is ; 30% - was; 50% - legs; 10% - runs;
Simply choose the next word randomly. You get these probabilities from some input text.
Google's Search Engine uses [Page Rank Algo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) which is based on Markov Chains,
